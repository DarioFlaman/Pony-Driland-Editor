## Character Information

### Specie

Female / Sphinx / Alicorn / Kirin

### Natural Habitat

Her home has an architecture inspired by the Egyptian culture. She has a pyramid as her home and lives on an extremely high cold mountain. Due to the extreme cold of the mountain, her natural habitat is covered by snow instead of sand. This allowed her to create a great passion for the cold climates.

She uses her divine elemental manipulation abilities to raise or lower her body temperature to her advantage in order to withstand any hot or cold temperatures, but this can use a lot of energy from her body.

### Hobby

Her favorite activity is helping the souls of the ponies who have recently died in Pony Driland. She has the ability to interact with souls, which other ponies cannot do that. She helps souls find acceptance of death to be safe and rest in peace. All the souls she collect are kept in a mysterious safe place, but it is unknown what secret place is.

### Personality (Incomplete)

Her personality is naturally malignant and dominant, but that doesn't make her a villain. She also has a good heart and is concerned with taking care of the creatures and her family who live in her dimension.
All her kind personality evolved with the help of her master.

Her personality is currently very unstable. She want to save Pony Driland and her life that depends exclusively on this dimension.

As she grew angrier, and her heart filled with hate and fear, it manifested in her appearance, making her more and more somber. If an extremely large reality shock occurs along this path, she can literally lose control of her powers and end up destroying herself due to the large concentration of energy released by her feelings out of control due to her emotional instability.

Divine powers are naturally increased through determination, fury, hatred, or love.
When she feel sad, as her feelings become unstable, her powers also become unstable.
If something serious like depression occurs, this instability can be greater, causing other dangerous negative feelings that can increase the power wildly while leaving the creature totally unstable and terrifying. her physical appearance becomes sinister as the negative personality becomes sinister, resulting in a frightening and intimidating appearance.

### Power

She has high grade divine abilities. She was created to help keep order in Pony Driland. Her immense ability to manipulate the dimension allowed her to be almost completely indestructible. Her magic and the aura in her body and mane are covered in rainbows due to her nature of manipulative power that can control the dimension.

She can freely create and produce whatever she wants. But she doesn't use her power in its entirety for she has an ethical conduct to keep the dimension in order with less interference from her possible actions. Her powers are limited to the dimension energy. Her abilities are also used to manipulate the amount of energy stored in the dimension, making her a guardian of Pony Driland's existence.

## Items

### Scythe

This weapon is the pure manifestation of her negative feelings. Divine creatures with negative feelings are extremely dangerous as their negative feelings can overload the amount of power evolved by anger, this scythe is invoked to try to drain the negative feelings and focus all the anger on a weapon where the negative energy can try to get controlled. But when this weapon is used, it can cause a great level of destruction due to the negative energies accumulated within it.
