## Items

### Collar

This is an indestructible magic collar created by Rainbow Queen. All pets that belong to her have this collar. In addition to a simple collar, it allows Rainbow Queen's pets to always have direct contact with her to request things like instant teleport to save the pets from any kind of danger.
